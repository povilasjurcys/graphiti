# Routes

Routes are generated via `GraphqlRails::Router.draw` method. It is very similar to rails router, except that instead of `match`, `get`, `post` actions you have `query` and `mutation` actions. In most cases you will use `resources` action. It works same as in rails router.

Here is simple router example:

```ruby
MyGraphqlSchema = GraphqlRails::Router.draw do
  # generates `friend`, `createFriend`, `updateFriend`, `destroyFriend`, `friends` routes
  resources :friends
  resources :shops, only: [:show, :index] # generates `shop` and `shops` routes only
  resources :orders, except: :update # generates all routes except `updateOrder`

  resources :users do
    # generates `findUser` query
    query :find, on: :member

    # generates `searchUsers` query
    query :search, on: :collection
  end

  # you can use namespaced controllers too:
  scope module: 'admin' do
    # `updateTranslations` route will be handeled by `Admin::TranslationsController`
    mutation :updateTranslations, to: 'translations#update'

    # all :groups routes will be handeled by `Admin::GroupsController`
    resources :groups
  end
end
```

## _resources_

`resources` method generates routes to `index`, `show`, `create`, `update` and `destroy` controller actions.

### _only_ and _except_ option

If you want to exclude some actions you can use `only` or `except` options.

```ruby
MyGraphqlSchema = GraphqlRails::Router.draw do
  resouces :users
  resouces :friends, only: :index
  resouces :posts, except: [:destroy, :index]
end
```

### custom actions

Sometimes it's handy so have non-CRUD actions in your controller. To define such route you can call `resources` with a block:

```ruby
MyGraphqlSchema = GraphqlRails::Router.draw do
  resouces :users do
    mutation :changePassword, on: :member
    query :active, on: :collection
  end
end
```

## _query_ and _mutation_

in case you want to have non-CRUD controller with custom actions you can define your own `query`/`mutation` actions like this:

```ruby
MyGraphqlSchema = GraphqlRails::Router.draw do
  mutation :logIn, to: 'sessions#login'
  query :me, to 'users#current_user'
end
```

## _scope_

### _module_ options

currently `scope` method accepts single option: `module`. `module` allows to specify controller namespace. So you can use scoped controllers, like so:

```ruby
MyGraphqlSchema = GraphqlRails::Router.draw do
  scope module: 'admin/top_secret' do
    mutation :logIn, to: 'sessions#login' # this will trigger Admin::TopSecret::SessionsController
  end

  mutation :logIn, to: 'sessions#login' # this will trigger ::SessionsController
end
```
